# Dogger
Website about dogs, recreated just for learning purposes.
The original project is here: https://preview.colorlib.com/theme/dogger/?fbclid=IwAR3C_tYKX0PJ2Qec07IWK6On_Wrs0BnfWWK7UEwVb319RGqrvAIhJJF-Xx8#blog-section  

This is my first larger one-page website. 
In this project I was using Sass (learning BEM too), Gsap for animations, and jquery carousel.
